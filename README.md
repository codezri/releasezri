# releasezri
A meaningful and minimalist release strategy for developers

Managing release notes manually is hard, So everyone tries to generate release notes automatically with commit messages. But, you won't get a meaningful release note at the end. releasezri offers you a simple strategy to maintain manual changelog and generate release notes automatically. It also offers you GitHub action template that you can simply copy-paste.
